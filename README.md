## üéØ Goal
To monitor and analyze the non-verbal communication progress of pre-verbal children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD).

---

## üìù Description

This project will enable the **daily/weekly/monthly logging of non-verbal behaviors** such as:

- Gestures (e.g., waving)
- Vocalizations
- Eye contact
- Reactions to simple commands

The data will be stored in a database (**SQLite or PostgreSQL**) and analyzed using **Python and Pandas**.

We are not sure about implementing a full dashboard, but we aim to create **basic visual outputs or summaries** of progress over time.

---

## ‚ú® Bonus Feature

We plan to support **multiple languages** (*Portuguese, English, and Hebrew*) for descriptions and interface elements ‚Äî making the tool accessible to both **parents and professionals** in multicultural environments.
